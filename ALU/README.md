ALU

With VHDL, we can build an ALU Operator that given the right signs, is able to perform the following actions : with "000" it can perform ADD logical operation, with "001" it can perform OR logical operation , with "010" it can perform the ADD which adds the signs, with "011" it can perform subtraction between the two signs, with "100" it can perform NAND logical operation, with "101" it can perform XOR Operation, with "110" XNOR Logical operation and with "111" ALU performs SLT operation. ALU Program can also be extended in order to build an entire MIPS Processor with the right additional tools.
